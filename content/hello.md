# Hello!
I'm Shaiya, a hobbyist programmer from the UK.

A lot of my projects are simple tools that help me with my everyday life or help me learn about technology in general. This blog is an incoherent showcase of all my random projects. 

Some posts are written as I develop the project, showcasing the code and the errors. Others are non-technical showcases that go into less detail about the technical sides of things. I have yet to find a "style" for this blog that I like, so I just write each project by feel.

Due to me attending school, I don't have as much time to write programs like I used to. So most of the projects you'll probably see here are smaller weekend projects that are focused on a specific technology.

## How to use the blog
The blog used to be over-engineered (that's a popular trend of mine).

Now it's much more simpler. Use the sidebar to see each category, click on the links in these categories to view each post. 

Most of the time I will stick to the same structure. A wide *category* which contains *projects* which contain separate *posts*. Although this is a relic from how the blog *used* to work. So I may break from this convention if I feel like that's a good idea.
