# Hello!
This is the first proper post on the blog. The previous post will stay up for "history" or "completeness". 

It took me a while to finish this "little side project" of mine for a few reasons. I hope at some point I can write both a technical breakdown of the site (not that it is *that* advanced) and also a project post-project analysis so that I can see what I did right and wrong during the course of this project.

I also hope to get started on content to populate this blog with. 

Already there are improvements to be made. With a weird github pages routing issue (which doesn't occur when I run using `npm run start`), and the lack of syntax highlighting in code blocks. These features will probably be coming soon, but they most likely won't get posts to announce them.
