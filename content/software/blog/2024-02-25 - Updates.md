# Updates....
The blog is up again! 

There was a big issue with the blog that I couldn't figure out for the longest time. I was using slugs to organise the blog. On the surface this isn't actually a big issue, however if I attempted to reload a page it would 404.

I think this is an issue on github pages end. Github pages didn't treat it like `/blog` with a bunch of slugs, it instead tried to actually treat the slugs as normal. 

Instead I've massively reworked the blog. It is *much* simpler on the backend and it all runs on a single page. This time the blog uses a single page and URL parameters. It looks messier in the URL but it functions way better this way.
