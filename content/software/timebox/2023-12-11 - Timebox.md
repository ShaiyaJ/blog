# [001] Timebox

## Intro - 2023/12/09

Midway through writing my project I thought it would be a good idea to start developing the general structure for my first "weekend project". This was going to be a tool that I've wanted for quite some time but I haven't found an accessible solution for.

The idea is to write a simple timer utility for timeboxing. 

### What is timeboxing?

Although it is slightly more complicated than this, I will explain it as: "the process of diving time into set 'chucks' and allocating different 'tasks' a set number of chunks to be completed in".

In short, it's a time management technique that can be used to make someone more productive, or to ensure that a certain number of tasks gets completed.

Here is a very simple example of using timeboxing for studying:

1. Read the biology textbook for 20 minutes
2. Practice a physics paper for 15 minutes
3. Watch YouTube for 10 minutes

This plan will be repeated in a cycle until some sort of "win condition" is met (in this case it would probably be along the lines of "finish x chapter of the textbook and complete all the questions in the physics paper").

You can also use this same technique to ensure that you are productive with your hobbies during leisure time.

1. Plan the timeboxing app for 20 minutes
2. Read "Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach" for 20 minutes
3. Watch 20 minutes of Mahjong strategy videos

This is the plan I used to ensure that this app got planned and written while also maintaining a certain level of productivity in my other hobbies.

It is also worth mentioning that timeboxing works with both units of time and quantities of work. Compare the two timeboxing plans:

1. Make notes on the Vietnam War textbook for 20 minutes
2. Read a book for leisure for 20 minutes

And:

1. Make notes on the Vietnam War textbook for 1 chapter
2. Read a book for leisure for 1 chapter

In this case, the second one is much more applicable. After the 20 minutes has elapsed, you may find yourself mid-way through a chapter. With the second model, you won't be in this situation.

This app will first focus on implementing the first kind of timebox, with some unit of time being used, but I may expand the app to include the second method at some point.

### Setting the requirements

Our requirements become quite clear after explaining this. We need:

1. A background timer that can keep track of what task we're on, which task is next and how much time is left of the current task.
2. Methods for adding, removing and modifying tasks from this timer - and updating it accordingly.
3. Methods for manipulating the timer in other ways - resetting, stopping or skipping the timer.
4. Frontend elements which compliment all of these timer functions.

As I am using react, each UI component can have its associated timer code bundled inside of it. With the common page having the current state of the timer.

### Creating a simple timer

Before I can work on managing any of the tasks within the timer state, I need to create a timer application.

I started with a `Timer.tsx` component which will eventually contain all the controls and logic for the entire application.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useState } from "react";

import TimerManger from "./TimerManager.tsx"

// Types
export type Task = {
    name: string,
    duration: number
}

function Timer() {
    const [taskList, setTaskList] = useState<Task[]>([]);
    const [currentTask, setCurrentTask] = useState<number>(0);
    const [timeLeft, setTimeLeft] = useState<number>(0);
    const [timerOn, setTimerOn] = useState<boolean>(false);


    return <>
    </>
}

export default Timer;
```

Inside this file we have a type, `Task`, which will represent a single task. We also have each important element of the state being created in with useState. We will pass these down to each sub-component.

I then attempted to implement a simple timer:

```jsx
function Timer() {
    const [taskList, setTaskList] = useState<Task[]>([]);
    const [currentTask, setCurrentTask] = useState<number>(0);
    const [timeLeft, setTimeLeft] = useState<number>(0);
    const [timerOn, setTimerOn] = useState<boolean>(false);

    useEffect(() => {
        const interval = setInterval(() => setTimeLeft(timeLeft-0.1), 100);
        return () => clearInterval(interval);
    }, [timeLeft])

    return <>
        {timeLeft}
    </>
}

export default Timer;
```

This produced a seemingly slow timer with a lot of floating point inaccuracies. So I changed the interval from 100ms to 1000ms. This decreases the resolution of the timer, but overall I feel the user won't be impacted all too much by this change.

I implemented some extra logic to include a check to see if the timer should count down.

```tsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { useState } from "react";

import TimerManger from "./TimerManager.tsx"

// Types
export type Task = {
    name: string,
    duration: number
}

function Timer() {
    const [taskList, setTaskList] = useState<Task[]>([]);
    const [currentTask, setCurrentTask] = useState<number>(0);
    const [timeLeft, setTimeLeft] = useState<number>(0);
    const [timerOn, setTimerOn] = useState<boolean>(false);

    useEffect(() => {
        if (!timerOn) {return}

        const interval = setInterval(() => setTimeLeft(timeLeft-1), 1000);
        return () => clearInterval(interval);
    }, [timeLeft])

    return <>
        {timeLeft}
    </>
}

export default Timer;
```

This is the final state of the timer until we implement functions that manipulate tasks and control of the timer.

### Adding timer controls

The next logical step is to add controls to the timer. For this I decided to have the following controls:

1. Toggle start/stop on the timer
2. Reset the current task
3. Skip the current task

We don't have any sort of system for implementing tasks yet. So to test the function I hardcoded the tasks:

```
[
    {
        name: "Task 1",
        duration: 10
    },

    {
        name: "Task 2", 
        duration: 10
    }
]
```

I then implemented the UI for controls in `TimerControl.tsx`:

```tsx
function TimerControl(
    { taskList, setTaskList, currentTask, setCurrentTask, timeLeft, setTimeLeft, timerOn, setTimerOn }:
    { taskList: Task[], setTaskList: any, currentTask: number, setCurrentTask: any, timeLeft: number, setTimeLeft: any, timerOn: boolean, setTimerOn: any }
) {
    if (timerOn) {
        setTimeout(() => {setTimeLeft(timeLeft - 0.1)}, 10);
    }

    return <>
        <h1>{timeLeft}</h1>
        <span>Current Task:</span> {taskList[currentTask].name}
        <button>Start/Stop</button>
        <button>Reset Task</button>
        <button>Skip Task</button>
    </>
}

export default TimerControl;
```

The buttons aren't linked to any functions at this point.

You can also see that I'm parsing quite a few props. Not all of these are used by the function - but to implement all 3 main control areas I copied the function names and parameters. This is temporary, and I will have a section later on dedicated to cleaning this up. 

I then implemented functions that achieved the desired controls:

```tsx
function toggleTimer(timerOn, setTimerOn) {
    setTimerOn(!timerOn);
}

function resetTask(taskList, currentTask, setTimeLeft) {
    setTimeLeft(taskList[currentTask].duration);
}

function nextTask(taskList, currentTask, setCurrentTask, setTimeLeft) {
    setCurrentTask(currentTask+1);
    setTimeLeft(taskList[currentTask+1].duration);
}
```

After binding these functions to the buttons I noticed a bug. The timer would count down when I hit "reset task", but it wouldn't toggle the pause correctly.

Eventually I identified the issue. `timeLeft` is a dependency in this function, when it's value is changed it causes the timeout function to run again (causing its value to change). However, if you pause the timer, the value doesn't update anymore. Even when you toggle the timer back on, the value will remain the same since the condition for a "tick" of the timer to be called hasn't been fulfilled.

Timer.tsx

```tsx
    useEffect(() => {
        printState(taskList, currentTask, timeLeft, timerOn);
        if (!timerOn || timeLeft === 0) {return}

        const interval = setInterval(() => setTimeLeft(timeLeft-1), 1000);
        return () => clearInterval(interval);
    }, [timeLeft, timerOn])
```

I updated the function accordingly, adding `timerOn` to the dependency list. I also wrote a utility function, `printState`, which simply prints the current state of the timer. This is for future debugging purposes. Finally, I added a condition that checks if `timeLeft` is zero. In this case, a different function which updates to the next task should run.

I did this by adding a simple if statement in `TimerControl` which, if true, runs `nextTask`. Some fixes needed to be applied to `nextTask` (adding a MOD operation to ensure the function doesn't attempt to load a task that doesn't exist.

This was the final feature in this file: 

TimerControl.tsx

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import type { Task } from "./Timer";

function toggleTimer(timerOn, setTimerOn) {
    setTimerOn(!timerOn);
}

function resetTask(taskList, currentTask, setTimeLeft) {
    setTimeLeft(taskList[currentTask].duration);
}

function nextTask(taskList, currentTask, setCurrentTask, setTimeLeft) {
    const nextTask = (currentTask+1) % taskList.length;
    setCurrentTask(nextTask);
    setTimeLeft(taskList[nextTask].duration);
}

function TimerControl(
    { taskList, setTaskList, currentTask, setCurrentTask, timeLeft, setTimeLeft, timerOn, setTimerOn }:
    { taskList: Task[], setTaskList: any, currentTask: number, setCurrentTask: any, timeLeft: number, setTimeLeft: any, timerOn: boolean, setTimerOn: any }
) {
    if (timeLeft <= 0) {
        nextTask(taskList, currentTask, setCurrentTask, setTimeLeft);
    }

    return <>
        <h1>{timeLeft}</h1>
        <span>Current Task:</span> {taskList[currentTask].name}                                                         <br />
        <button onClick={() => toggleTimer(timerOn, setTimerOn)}                                >Start/Stop</button>    <br />
        <button onClick={() => resetTask(taskList, currentTask, setTimeLeft)}                   >Reset Task</button>    <br />
        <button onClick={() => nextTask(taskList, currentTask, setCurrentTask, setTimeLeft)}    >Skip Task</button>     <br />
    </>
}

export default TimerControl;
```

### Adding, removing and editing tasks

At the moment we have a timer that counts down from 0. But we don't have any tasks. Tasks will provide a duration for the timer to count down from, and a duration to update to after the task has finished.

I had to work on a `TaskManager.tsx`. All I need at the moment is a method of:

1. Displaying each task in the `taskList`
2. Adding new tasks to the `taskList`
3. Modifying existing tasks inside the `taskList`

I first worked on the general structure

```jsx
function TaskManager(
    { taskList, setTaskList, currentTask, setCurrentTask, timeLeft, setTimeLeft }:
    { taskList: Task[], setTaskList: any, currentTask: number, setCurrentTask: any, timeLeft: number, setTimeLeft: any }
) {
    return <>
        {
            // Generating html for each task
            taskList.map((task, idx) => {                                                                                                                                               // ADDME: highlight current task
                return <div key={idx}>
                    <button onClick={ () => removeTask(taskList, setTaskList, currentTask, setCurrentTask, idx) }>X</button>
                    <input type="text"   value={task.name}     onChange={ (e) => editTask(taskList, setTaskList, idx, {name: e.target.value, duration: task.duration } ) } />
                    <input type="number" value={task.duration} onChange={ (e) => editTask(taskList, setTaskList, idx, {name: task.name, duration: parseInt(e.target.value) } ) } min={1} />
                </div>
            })
        }

        {/*Adding tasks*/} 
        
        <div>
            <button onClick={ () => addTask(taskList, setTaskList) }>+</button>
        </div>
    </>
}

export default TaskManager;
```

This displays all tasks, with controls to manipulate the underlying state of each task. It ends with a button which adds blank tasks to the state.

Finally, I implemented the state manipulation that occurs when you use the controls:

```jsx
function addTask(taskList: Task[], setTaskList: any) {
    setTaskList([
        ...taskList, 
        { name: "", duration: 1 }
    ]);
}

function editTask(taskList: Task[], setTaskList: any, index: number, value: Task) {
    if (value.duration <= 0 || Number.isNaN(value.duration)) {  // Range check to force value to "1" to avoid weird skipping behavior
        value.duration = 1;
    }

    setTaskList(
        taskList.map((task, idx) => {
            if (idx === index) {
                return value;
            } else {
                return task;
            }
        })
    );
}

function removeTask(taskList: Task[], setTaskList: any, currentTask, setCurrentTask, index: number) {    // FIXME 
    setTaskList(
        taskList.filter(t => taskList.indexOf(t) !== index)
    ); 

    if (index <= currentTask) {
        setCurrentTask(index);
    }
} 
```

A few bodges can be seen as I encountered a few errors.

The first was the attempt to read properties of tasks when there weren't any in the taskList, this returned `undefined`, and caused an error.

The second was recursion which occurred due to either

a) `nextTask` being infinitely called as new tasks have duration "0"

b) Duration input boxes containing `NaN` or values below 0

c) `currentTask` pointing to a value that has been deleted

As a result, `TaskManager.tsx` also had to be edited.

TaskManager.tsx
```jsx
function addTask(taskList: Task[], setTaskList: any) {
    setTaskList([
        ...taskList, 
        { name: "", duration: 1 }
    ]);
}

function editTask(taskList: Task[], setTaskList: any, index: number, value: Task) {
    if (value.duration <= 0 || Number.isNaN(value.duration)) {  // Range check to force value to "1" to avoid weird skipping behavior
        value.duration = 1;
    }

    setTaskList(
        taskList.map((task, idx) => {
            if (idx === index) {
                return value;
            } else {
                return task;
            }
        })
    );
}

function removeTask(taskList: Task[], setTaskList: any, currentTask, setCurrentTask, index: number) {    // FIXME 
    setTaskList(
        taskList.filter(t => taskList.indexOf(t) !== index)
    ); 

    if (index <= currentTask) {
        setCurrentTask(index);
    }
} 

function TaskManager(
    { taskList, setTaskList, currentTask, setCurrentTask, timeLeft, setTimeLeft }:
    { taskList: Task[], setTaskList: any, currentTask: number, setCurrentTask: any, timeLeft: number, setTimeLeft: any }
) {
    return <>
        {
            // Generating html for each task
            taskList.map((task, idx) => {                                                                                                                                               // ADDME: highlight current task
                return <div key={idx}>
                    <button onClick={ () => removeTask(taskList, setTaskList, currentTask, setCurrentTask, idx) }>X</button>
                    <input type="text"   value={task.name}     onChange={ (e) => editTask(taskList, setTaskList, idx, {name: e.target.value, duration: task.duration } ) } />
                    <input type="number" value={task.duration} onChange={ (e) => editTask(taskList, setTaskList, idx, {name: task.name, duration: parseInt(e.target.value) } ) } min={1} />
                </div>
            })
        }

        {/*Adding tasks*/} 
        
        <div>
            <button onClick={ () => addTask(taskList, setTaskList) }>+</button>
        </div>
    </>
}

export default TaskManager;
```

## Conclusion
Overall this was a pretty fun project to work on. I feel I learned a lot about react while poking around it's functions (and while solving the various issues that I had with it). 

I'm hoping I can do more projects in react in the future, so you may see some react-based projects pop up in the future.

Although, due to my lack of experience and ability in this framework, I do eventually want to do a sort of "post-mortem" post, going through the code with someone who has more experience than me and getting their opinion on my implementations (and sometimes bodge-y workarounds for issues). Hopefully that will be a nice exercise in learning cleaner react code.

I ended up overrunning the time a little bit - I'm currently writing the final part of this post during monday (which is also when I pushed the first version into master and deployed it). There were quite a few features that I wanted to add but I didn't really have the time to. The core functionality alone ran me into enough errors which required deeper research about react to be conducted. I can't imagine how much time it would have taken me to implement some of these "extras". 

I also need to fix some bugs which are still in the app, mainly surround removing tasks.

However, it is for that reason that I might dedicate a future weekend into implementing these features. At which point, a new post will be pushed to this part of the blog. Until then, thank you for reading!
