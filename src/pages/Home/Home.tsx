            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Shaiya, a hobbyist software developer. At the moment I'm still attending school, so this blog may go through periods of inactivity due to exams, etc. Due to this, I also tend to go for either projects with a small scope or learning new technologies. I'm always trying to improve my programming skills, so feel free to critique me!</p>
            <h3>What I make</h3>
            <p>A lot of my projects are simple tools that help me with my everyday life or help me learn about technology in general.</p>
            <p>My primary approach to learning is to just <i>do it</i>. This way I can both learn from more formal sources (video tutorials, documentation or other code) while also being able to play with the technology at my own pace. Sadly, this means this blog won't get populated very often. A lot of the projects that I use to learn things never amount to anything - once I understand something I don't need the project anymore, so it usually gets left in the dust. I also won't populate this blog with the smaller scripts that I've made before, a lot of those are stored on old computers of mine and haven't been open sourced (partly because I lacked the foresight to transfer/backup those old projects, but also partly because I'm quite embarrassed about my coding ability 2-4 years ago).</p>
            <p>The projects that I do upload will probably be smaller weekend projects or the rare long-term project.</p>
            <p>Because of my lack of output when it comes to programming, I'm focused on just getting small things out to showcase what I can do. But I can't help my other hobbies getting in the way of this goal.</p>
            <h2>Blog Organisation</h2>
            <p>This blog is organised into wide <b>categories</b> which contain <b>projects</b>, and individual posts are apart of a <b>project</b>.</p>
            <p>The URL should look like <i>/blog/[category]/[project]/[post]</i></p>
            <p>You can find the categories in the navbar.</p>
