# Timebox is finished!
At least the base functionality....

Since the last post I've switched out out the "skip task" button with a "next task" and "previous task" button.

There is an audio chime that plays when the task has been completed. However, I didn't manage to get notifications to work properly - this chime was a replacement for the notifications approach. In a way I feel like this isn't as elegant, but I *do* think it's more practical. Most people that I know have notifications automatically disabled. Switching the permissions in a web browser isn't as quick as just toggling the "tab mute" button. 

I've also heavily worked on the CSS. I still don't think it looks great, but it's better than nothing. The app doesn't respond well to being forced into an area smaller than 500px. I think it's reasonable to assume that most people would probably have this app on their phone or second screen while working - but I know for me specifically this is bad. I like to shove the app in the corner of a single screen. This is something to look into fixing in the future.

Finally I've made the timer work on a more familiar `hh:mm:ss` format instead of just seconds. When using the app as an actual revision tool I found it cumbersome to constantly convert the times that I wanted into seconds.

To implement these features I needed to refactor the `nextTask` function to act more like a "current task offset" function. Workarounds also had to be implemented to make the queue cyclical when using the "previous task" button. I also needed to convert seconds into hours, minutes and seconds on the fly.

The way I've implemented these things isn't the most elegant but it does function. The project is small enough where small things like that can be largely ignored. However, I don't like the idea of letting them sit, especially if I'm going to be coming back to this project to improve it. So I may have a full code review soon.

Example of the time conversion: 
```ts
    const h = Math.floor(timeLeft / 3600).toString();
    const m = Math.floor(timeLeft % 3600 / 60).toString();
    const s = Math.floor(timeLeft % 3600 % 60).toString();

    const dh = h.length === 1 ? `0${h}` : h;
    const dm = m.length === 1 ? `0${m}` : m;
    const ds = s.length === 1 ? `0${s}` : s;
```

Example of the `nextTask` rewrite:
```ts
function offsetCurrentTask(taskList: Task[], currentTask: number, setCurrentTask: any, setTimeLeft: any, timerOn: boolean, diff: number) {
    // Avoiding never ending loops
    if (taskList.length === 0) {return}                                     // Avoids never ending loop when taskList's length is 0
    if (taskList.every((task) => {return task.duration === 0})) {return}    // Avoids never ending "nextTask" calls when all durations are 0

    // Calculating next task index in taskList
    // If the next task's position is -1 then it wraps around the taskList, to the last task
    // Otherwise it limits the value by the length of the task list (% taskList.length) to avoid index errors
    const nextTask = (currentTask + diff) === -1 ? taskList.length-1 : (currentTask + diff) % taskList.length;

    // Setting currentTask
    setCurrentTask(nextTask);
    setTimeLeft(taskList[nextTask].duration);

    // Displaying notification
    if (timerOn) {
        playSound();
    }
}
```

`playSound()`
```ts
async function playSound() {   // ADDME: option to upload own audio
    const audio = new Audio(require("../assets/alarm.mp3"));

    const audioPromise = audio.play();
    if (audioPromise !== undefined) {
        audioPromise
            .then(() => {
                // autoplay started
                console.log("works");
            })
            .catch((err) => {
                // catch dom exception
                console.info(err);
            });
    }
} 
```

That's all for this update, I know it's quite small but it makes a lot of difference to the usability of the app!
